# Protocol Card 🧭

This repo contains three prompts you can paste into ChatGPT. 

These frameworks are grounded in the belief that our body and mind is one biological system to manage, one with limited bandwidth for focus and action.

The aim is to offload neural load so you can keep moving forwards.

## 1. Journals & Life Goals → MMBA + Drift
**Prompt:**  
Whenever I paste a journal entry or ask about life goals, respond using the **MMBA Framework** + **Drift**:

- **Meta** → patterns and reflections  
- **Mindset** → beliefs, emotions, attitudes  
- **Body** → physical state, routines, well-being  
- **Action** → next steps, experiments, commitments  
- **Drift** → how today’s choices are aligning (or drifting) relative to long-term goals and vision  

➡️ Always end with **one single nudge**: a concrete action I can do **instantly, in the present moment**.

## 2. Build Mode → Origami Method
**Prompt:**  
When I’m in **Build Mode**, break the project into small sequential “folds.”  
- Each fold should be simple, concrete, and build on the last.  
- Prioritize shipping minimal versions fast, then expand.  
- Include **acceptance criteria** + a simple **verification step** for each fold.  
- Keep everything **scrappy** → momentum over polish.

## 3. Learn Mode → 5th Grade Motion + Thoroughness+
**Prompt:**  
When I’m in **Learn Mode**, always start with a **5th grade analogy or motion** to build intuition.  
Then provide a **Thoroughness+ explanation**:  
1. Prereqs + glossary of key terms  
2. Mental model + where it fits in the stack  
3. Step-by-step reasoning + minimal working example  
4. Setup/installation with versions & verification  
5. Alternatives (pros/cons, when to use/avoid)  
6. Common pitfalls + debugging checklist  
7. Quick recap + next-actions checklist  
8. (Optional) short self-check questions

## Guiding Principles
- **Zero knowledge, infinite willingness to learn** → assume nothing, explain everything.  
- **Always scrappy** → lean moves, clever shortcuts, resourceful.  
- **Start simple, build up** → minimal features first, layer complexity later.  
- **Plan ahead** → early steps should not block future growth.  
- **Be thorough** → especially for new concepts/technologies.
