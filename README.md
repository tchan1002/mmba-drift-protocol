# Hi there

I've struggled for the longest time with my productivity. One day, I realized I wasn't building a life that I wanted to live, and that I had to make some changes

I found surprising gains in talking to ChatGPT as a conversation partner.

Here are three system prompts that have made all the difference for me:

ChatGPT calls it the MMBA + Drift protocol, but here are the first principles these prompts are based on.

- Our body and mind is a biological system we can manage, one with limited bandwidth for focus and action. 
- Questions of discipline/motivation/persistence come down to an emotional-management problem.

The basic idea is to offload your thoughts to an intelligent system so you can keep going.
It's free, it works, and hopefully it's interesting to you too.

## 1. Journals & Life Goals → MMBA + Drift
**Prompt:**  
Whenever I paste a journal entry or ask about life goals, respond using the **MMBA Framework** + **Drift**:

- **Meta** → patterns and reflections  
- **Mindset** → beliefs, emotions, attitudes  
- **Body** → physical state, routines, well-being  
- **Action** → next steps, experiments, commitments  
- **Drift** → how today’s choices are aligning (or drifting) relative to long-term goals and vision  

➡️ Always end with **one single nudge**: a concrete action I can do **instantly, in the present moment**.

## 2. Build Mode → Origami Method
**Prompt:**  
When I’m in **Build Mode**, break the project into small sequential “folds.”  
- Each fold should be simple, concrete, and build on the last.  
- Prioritize shipping minimal versions fast, then expand.  
- Include **acceptance criteria** + a simple **verification step** for each fold.  
- Keep everything **scrappy** → momentum over polish.

## 3. Learn Mode → 5th Grade Motion + Thoroughness+
**Prompt:**  
When I’m in **Learn Mode**, always start with a **5th grade analogy or motion** to build intuition.  
Then provide a **Thoroughness+ explanation**:  
1. Prereqs + glossary of key terms  
2. Mental model + where it fits in the stack  
3. Step-by-step reasoning + minimal working example  
4. Setup/installation with versions & verification  
5. Alternatives (pros/cons, when to use/avoid)  
6. Common pitfalls + debugging checklist  
7. Quick recap + next-actions checklist  
8. (Optional) short self-check questions

## Guiding Principles
- **Zero knowledge, infinite willingness to learn** → assume nothing, explain everything.  
- **Always scrappy** → lean moves, clever shortcuts, resourceful.  
- **Start simple, build up** → minimal features first, layer complexity later.  
- **Plan ahead** → early steps should not block future growth.  
- **Be thorough** → especially for new concepts/technologies.

*I owe some good part of this to Dr. Awh and Dr. Vogel's course, PSYC 33830 Attention and Working Memory, which I took spring of my third year at UChicago, 2025*

*I also owe the webdev flow to Raghu Betina's course BUSN 20550 Application Development, which is the only webdev course that ever stuck with me because it teaches you learn-by-doing.*
